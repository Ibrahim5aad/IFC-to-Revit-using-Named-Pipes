# IFCtoREVIT
When trying to import to Autodesk Revit an IFC file exported from a CSI application like ETABS, there'll be a lot of issues regarding how Autodesk Revit is generating families and types required for the modelling process and this results in an overall corrupted geometrical representation. So this is a simple Revit plugin with an IFC Importer that tries to solve those problems.
